                        <p>I understand that methods of treatment may include, but are not limited to, Acupuncture, Acupressure, Moxibustion, Cupping, Electrical Stimulation, Tuina (Chinese massage), Chinese herbal medicine, and nutritional counseling. I understand that the herbs may need to be prepared and the teas consumed according to the instructions provided orally and in writing. The herbs may have an unpleasant smell or taste. I will immediately notify a member of the clinical staff of any unanticipated or unpleasant effects associated with the consumption of the herbs.</p>

                    <h3>Risks and Side Effects</h3>
                    <div class="consent-text">
                        <p>I have been informed that acupuncture is a generally safe method of treatment, but that it may have some side effects, including bruising, numbness or tingling near the needling sites that may last a few days, and dizziness or fainting. Burns and/or scarring are a potential risk of moxibustion and cupping, or when treatment involves the use of heat lamps. Bruising is a common side effect of cupping. Unusual risks of acupuncture include spontaneous miscarriage, nerve damage and organ puncture, including lung puncture (pneumothorax). Infection is another possible risk, although the clinic uses sterile disposable needles and maintains a clean and safe environment.</p>
                        <p>I understand that while this document describes the major risks of treatment, other side effects and risks may occur. The herbs and nutritional supplements (which are from plant, animal and mineral sources) that have been recommended are traditionally considered safe in the practice of Chinese Medicine, although some may be toxic in large doses. I understand that some herbs may be inappropriate during pregnancy. Some possible side effects of taking herbs are nausea, gas, stomach ache, vomiting, headache, diarrhea, rashes, hives, and tingling of the tongue. I will notify a clinical staff member who is caring for me if I am or become pregnant.</p>

I understand that results are not guaranteed.</p>
